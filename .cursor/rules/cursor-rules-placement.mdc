### Cursor rule placement and naming

- "Cursor rules" are project conventions files for Cursor and must follow these requirements:
  - Always live in `.cursor/rules/`
  - Always begin with MDC YAML front matter as described in the Cursor docs
    - Required: `description`
    - Optional: `globs`, `alwaysApply`
  - `globs` must be a scalar file-only pattern (no lists, no dirglobs, no quotes). Example: `*.rb`
  - Filenames must end with `.mdc`
  - Filenames must follow `TYPE-RULE_NAME.mdc`
    - `TYPE` is usually the programming language (e.g., `python`, `typescript`) but may also be other scopes such as `cursor`

#### Language-scoped rules (globs)

- If a rule is scoped to a language (as indicated by `TYPE` in the filename), add an appropriate file-only `globs` pattern so the rule can auto-attach when those files are referenced.
- Suggested `globs` by language (file-only, scalar):
  - TypeScript: `*.ts`
  - JavaScript: `*.js`
  - Python: `*.py`
  - Go: `*.go`
  - Rust: `*.rs`

Example front matter for a TypeScript-scoped rule:

```yaml
---
description: Enforce TypeScript import conventions
globs: *.ts
alwaysApply: false
---
```

#### Examples

- Correct
  - `.cursor/rules/python-formatting.mdc`
  - `.cursor/rules/typescript-imports.mdc`
  - `.cursor/rules/cursor-rules-placement.mdc`

- Incorrect
  - `.cursor/cursor-rules-placement.md` (wrong directory and extension)
  - `rules/cursor-rules-placement.mdc` (wrong directory)
  - `.cursor/rules/JS.mdc` (does not follow `TYPE-RULE_NAME` pattern)
