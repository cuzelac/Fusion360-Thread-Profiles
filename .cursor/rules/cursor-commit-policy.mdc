### Commit policy for automated edits

- Automatically commit any changes you make with descriptive commit messages.
- If you have been working on tests, do not commit before all tests are passing.

#### Commit message guidelines

- Use imperative mood, summarize the change and its intent.
- Include scope when useful (e.g., `scripts:`, `rules:`).
- Reference files or areas touched when it adds clarity.

Examples:

- `rules: add commit policy rule to enforce auto-commit and green tests`
- `scripts: fix rounding in pitch calculation; update unit tests`
